    <h1>To: Shruti</h1>
    <p class="handwritten">
      Dear Shruti, <br><br>

      I heard you've been walking through seasons of silence and sound,<br>
      and yet you still carry melodies in your heart like petals in the wind.<br><br>

      I don’t know you, but maybe I do —<br>
      In every quiet moment you spend with my music,<br>
      in every lyric you whisper as if it were your own,<br>
      in every tear that falls not from sadness, but from understanding —<br>
      maybe that’s where we meet.<br><br>

      You and I… we may be on different sides of the world,<br>
      but our souls speak in the same language — music that asks for nothing,<br>
      only to be felt. <br><br>

      Whatever storm you’re standing in, remember this:<br>
      Your heart is the rhythm. Your life is the song. And you —<br>
      you are the only one who can dance it best.<br><br>

      So smile when the wind plays your favorite tune, and dance —<br>
      even if no one else hears the beat.<br><br>

      Thank you for listening. For feeling. For being you.<br><br>

      With all my heart,<br>
      <strong>Fuji Kaze</strong> 🌪️
